This guide describes two ways to install **DDC**:

* **Quick start build** → fastest way to compile the core features.
* **Spack installation** → recommended for reproducible builds and HPC environments.

---

## Quick Start (core features only)

This method compiles DDC with all optional components disabled.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules --jobs 4 https://github.com/CExA-project/ddc.git
cmake -D DDC_BUILD_KERNELS_FFT=OFF \
      -D DDC_BUILD_KERNELS_SPLINES=OFF \
      -D DDC_BUILD_PDI_WRAPPER=OFF \
      -B ddc/build
cmake --build ddc/build --parallel 4
ctest --test-dir ddc/build
cmake --install ddc/build --prefix $HOME/.local/ddc
```

\note Replace `$HOME/.local/ddc` with your preferred installation path.

### Using the installed package

To use DDC in your CMake project, point CMake to the installation prefix:

```bash
cmake -D DDC_ROOT=$HOME/.local/ddc <your_project>
```

Then in your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
find_package(DDC REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(myapp PRIVATE DDC::core)
```

## Installing with Spack

This method leverages the [Spack package manager](https://spack.io/) for reproducible builds and dependency management.
It is recommended on HPC systems or if you want an isolated environment.

### 1. Install Spack

Download and extract the latest Spack release (replace version if newer is available):

```bash
wget https://github.com/spack/spack/releases/download/v1.0.1/spack-1.0.1.tar.gz
tar -xvf spack-1.0.1.tar.gz
rm spack-1.0.1.tar.gz
```

### 2. Activate Spack

Spack must be activated before use:

```bash
. spack-1.0.1/share/spack/setup-env.sh
```

\note Add this line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` to avoid reactivating in each new shell.

### 3. Install DDC

To avoid polluting other Spack setups, create a dedicated environment:

```bash
spack env create ddc-env
```

Pin the Spack built-in packages repository to the commit of DDC recipe release (ensures recipe compatibility):

```bash
spack --env ddc-env repo update builtin --commit 633ec00a198102d61e7ffcdd551cd455a8689e66
```

\note Starting from **Spack packages v2025.7.0**, this step will no longer be needed.

Add and install DDC with default variants:

```bash
spack --env ddc-env add ddc
spack --env ddc-env install
```

\note Installation may take some time, as Spack builds required dependencies from source.

### 4. Use DDC from Spack

Activate the environment:

```bash
spack env activate ddc-env
```

Now any CMake project can find DDC automatically:

```cmake
find_package(DDC REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(myapp PRIVATE DDC::core)
```

To discover available build variants:

```bash
spack info ddc
```

If you encounter issues with the Spack recipe, please open an issue on the [spack-packages repository](https://github.com/spack/spack-packages/issues).

✅ You now have DDC installed and ready to use!
